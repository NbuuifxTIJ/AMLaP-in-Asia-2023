	abstract = {First Published in 1997. Mandarin ziji has challenged many syntacticians to probe for its properties and specifically its relationship to Binding Condition A (BCA), which dictates that an anaphor must be bound by a syntactically prominent (or c-commanding) noun phrase in a very local domain (Governing Category or GC). This book argues for the separation of contrastive and non-contrastive reflexives. This book will also show that ben-ren/shen and their compound forms, being inherently contrastive, differ from ziji and its compound forms in the contexts accessible to them; the latter can access linguistic contexts only, but the former can also access utterance situations and world knowledge.},

	abstract = {The relationship between a reflexive and its antecedent is characterized by (a) a locality condition, and (b) a syntactic prominence condition. In Chomsky (1981) locality is defined in terms of governing category, and syntactic prominence is via c-command. In this article I show that, to account for the long-distance binding properties of complex reflexive ta-ziji '3s-self' in Chinese, properties which cast doubt on 'Pica's generalization' that only morphologically simplex reflexives can be long-distance bound, locality should be regulated by a closeness condition. Locality is thus considered a relative rather than a strict condition. I propose that the prominence condition should be defined in terms of animacy hierarchy for Chinese reflexive ta-ziji. Thus, the interpretation of reflexives is unified not under Chomsky's Binding Condition A, but under the Anaphor Condition proposed in this article, which is defined in terms of closeness and prominence. It is suggested that languages differ only in their definitions of prominence.},

Participants’ eye movements were recorded while they read short texts which included anaphoric references with reflexive anaphors (himself or herself). In each of the experiments, two characters were introduced into the discourse before the anaphor, and only one of these characters was a grammatical antecedent for the anaphor in terms of binding theory. Both experiments showed that Principle A of the binding theory operates at the very earliest stages of processing; early eye-movement measures showed evidence of processing difficulty when the gender of the reflexive anaphor mismatched the stereotypical gender of the grammatical antecedent. However, the gender of the ungrammatical antecedent had no effect on early processing, although it affected processing during later stages in Experiment 1. An additional experiment showed that the gender of the ungrammatical antecedent also affected the likelihood of participants settling on an ungrammatical final interpretation. The results are interpreted in relation to the notions of bonding and resolution in reference processing.},

	abstract = {Within Generative Grammar, binding constraints on co-reference are usually defined in syntactic terms. However, some researchers have pointed out examples in which syntactically defined bind- ing constraints do not seem to apply, proposing instead that a complete account of linguistic co- reference needs to consider notions of discourse structure. There have been several proposals in the literature for the division of labor between syntax and discourse in the definition of binding constraints. In this paper, we review these proposals in the context of recent work that applies on- line techniques to explore the roles of syntactic and discourse preferences in terms of the time course with which they become active during sentence comprehension. Some of this research sug- gests that (syntactic) binding principles may be momentarily applied during processing, even in cases in which the final interpretation suggests otherwise. We end the paper by considering the theoretical and methodological implications of this view.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that the binding properties exhibited by Chinese compound reflexives like 'ta-ziji' (s/he-self) can be best explained if an Optimality-theoretic (OT, Prince \& Smolensky 1993) account of reflexivization is adopted. It claims that Prominence and Locality are the two important factors that regulate the interpretation of reflexives in different languages and their different rankings can account for the difference between English and Chinese in reflexive binding. This paper argues that in Chinese, Prominence Constraint (PC) is ranked higher than Locality Constraint (LC), whereas in English, LC is ranked higher than PC. 本文用优选论（Optimality Theory) 的基本思路来解释汉语复合反身代词的约束 特性。本文认为制约反身代词约束的因素主要有两个，一个是显著性 (prominence). 另ー个是局部性 （locality)。显著性与局部性在不同语言中地位 的不同可以解释不同语言中反身代词约束特性的不同，汉语复合反身代词与英 语反身代词的区別正因为这两个因素在汉、英两种语言中的语法地位不同。本 文认为在汉语复合反身代词约束中，显著性限制的地位高于局部性限制，而在 英语中，局部性限制的地位则高于显著性限制。},

The experiments (two off-line studies and two visual-world eye-tracking experiments) investigate how syntactic and semantic factors guide the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives and how different kinds of information are integrated during real-time reference resolution. The results show that the interpretation of pronouns and reflexives in picture NP constructions is sensitive not only to purely structural information, as is commonly assumed in syntactically-oriented theories of anaphor resolution, but also to semantic information (see ; ). Moreover, the results show that pronouns and reflexives differ in the degree of sensitivity they exhibit to different kinds of information. This finding indicates that the form-specific multiple-constraints approach (see ; ; ; ), which states that referential forms can exhibit asymmetrical sensitivities to the different constraints guiding reference resolution, also applies in the within-sentence domain.},
